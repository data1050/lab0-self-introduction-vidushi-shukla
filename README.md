## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi! My name is Vidushi Shukla. 
I'm a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering.
I grew up in Mumbai, India. I'm not sure I can pick one favourite food, to be honest. I miss a lot of food from Mumbai.
My hobbies including reading (really only fiction) and jigsaw puzzles.
